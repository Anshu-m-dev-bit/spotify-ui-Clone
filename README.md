# spotify-ui-Clone
Spotify-inspired music player built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This was my first web development project, focused on learning UI design, basic music controls, and DOM manipulation.


## 📖 Project Description
This project is a Spotify-inspired music player built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It is my **first web development project**, created while learning the basics of front-end development. The main objective of this project was to understand how web pages are structured, styled, and made interactive using core web technologies.

The application features a clean and simple user interface inspired by Spotify and includes basic music player functionalities such as play, pause, and track navigation. Working on this project helped me gain hands-on experience with web layouts, CSS styling, JavaScript logic, and DOM manipulation.
